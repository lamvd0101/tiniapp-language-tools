Additionally, LSP is capable of powering plugins for [numerous other IDEs](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/).

## Packages

This repo uses [`yarn workspaces`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/), which TLDR means if you want to run a commands in each project then you can either `cd` to that directory and run the command, or use `yarn workspace [package_name] [command]`.

For example `yarn workspace tiniapp-vsce build`.

## Development

### Setup

Pull requests are encouraged and always welcome. [Pick an issue](https://github.com/tikivn/tiniapp-language-tools/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and help us out!

To install and work on these tools locally:

> Make sure to uninstall the extension from the marketplace to not have it clash with the local one.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/tikivn/tiniapp-language-tools.git tiniapp-language-tools
cd tiniapp-language-tools

# Install dependencies
yarn
```

> Do not use npm to install the dependencies, as the specific package versions in `yarn.lock` are used to build and test Tini App.

To build all of the tools, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

The tools are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but don't let that put you off â€” it's basically just JavaScript with type annotations. You'll pick it up in no time. If you're using an editor other than [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and code hints etc.

## Run

To run the VSCode extension:

- Open the root of this repo in VSCode
- Make sure "Run VSCode Extension" is selected, and hit run
- Then, inside the editor, press F5. This will compile and run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.
